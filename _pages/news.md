üöÄ **Exciting News in Drone Delivery Tech!** üöÄ

We just explored a groundbreaking study titled **"Efficient Strategies for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flights: Analyzing Battery Life and Operational Performance in Delivery Services using Stochastic Models"** published in *IEEE Access*. This research, conducted by Francisco Airton Silva, Vandirleya Barbosa, Luiz Nelson Lima, Arthur Sabino, Paulo Rego, Luiz F. Bittencourt, Jae-Woo Lee, Dugki Min, and Tuan Anh Nguyen, is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in UAV (drone) delivery services! üîã‚úàÔ∏è

**What's the Buzz?**

We introduced two advanced models to evaluate and boost drone delivery efficiency. Whether it's solo drone missions or cooperative ones (where drones hand off packages to each other), these models are helping us understand how to make drone deliveries faster, more reliable, and way more efficient!

**Why Does This Matter?**

- **Strategic Charging:** The study shows that where we place charging stations can make or break the delivery times. Think faster deliveries, fewer delays!
- **Cooperation is Key:** Drones working together are more effective, especially in busy urban areas. More drones, less hassle!
- **Optimized Operations:** The research highlights the importance of careful planning ‚Äì from the number of drones to how long they charge ‚Äì to maximize efficiency.

**The Future of Drone Deliveries is Here!** üõ∏üí®

This research sets the stage for a new era in logistics, where drone deliveries are not just a concept but a highly optimized, efficient reality. 

Curious about the details? Dive into the full study in *IEEE Access* and see how these strategies can revolutionize our delivery services!

# üöÄ SHANGUS: Redefining Autonomous Exploration with Deep Reinforcement Learning

I am pleased to share some exciting advancements in our research and development at the Distributed Multimedia Systems Laboratory (DMS). Our team has been working diligently on SHANGUS, an innovative framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with heuristic optimization to improve autonomous exploration in unknown environments.

## Key Highlights:

üîπ **Integration of DRL and Heuristic Optimization:** SHANGUS combines the adaptability of DRL with heuristic prioritization to enhance exploration efficiency, reduce completion time, and minimize travel distance.

# Pilot-in-the-loop simulation with virtual reality (PILS-VR) running on top of cloud-in-the-loop simulation (CILS)

I am excited to share the progress our team has made in a short period. It was an honor to represent our group at the Conference on Automation, Control, and Robotics Engineering (CACRE 2024) in Jeju. Our collaboration with Korean students, combined with the relentless efforts of our Vietnamese team at KADA, has led to remarkable developments. 

In a short time, we have successfully expanded our Pilot-in-the-Loop Simulation (PILS) system by integrating it with Virtual Reality (VR) on the Cloud-in-the-Loop Simulation (CILS) platform. A special thanks to my colleagues: Dr. Vinh Vinh Ph·∫°m, Nghƒ©a, and Nguy·ªÖn Vi·∫øt Nghƒ©a. Please excuse the rudimentary graphics as our focus wasn't on 3D development.

## PILS-VR System Overview

In this video, we showcase our innovative system developed at the Konkuk Aerospace Design Airworthiness Institute (KADA). We've successfully integrated PILS with our Cloud-in-the-Loop Simulation (CILS) system, built on the KP-2 platform for Future Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).

**Highlights of PILS-VR:**

- **Realistic VR Training:** Experience a highly immersive training environment that simulates real-world flight conditions and emergency scenarios.
- **Cloud-Based Flexibility:** Seamless integration with CILS enables remote access, real-time data analysis, and collaborative training, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.
- **Cost-Effective Solutions:** Reduce traditional training costs and increase accessibility with our advanced VR and cloud technologies.
- **Personalized Feedback:** Benefit from detailed performance tracking and tailored feedback to accelerate learning and improve skills.

Join us to see how PILS-VR is revolutionizing pilot training and setting new standards in aviation safety.

### Data Exchange Method Development

[Watch our video on the method to extract data exchanged between KFDS and PX4 during simulation run-time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BYQKzVgXeQ)

Using this method, we can input control signal data from pre-existing files into KFDS, which then loads these control data according to the predetermined times specified in the files. Subsequently, the flight state data generated by KFDS are recorded for validation or virtual certification purposes.

### (p/d) Twin Data Center

[Watch our video on Twin Data Center](https://youtu.be/byyYU9jCaTk)

All data from KFDS and PX4 are collected in run-time simulation for further analysis and prediction for future updates of digital twin models in the virtual world.

# <span style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:18pt; font-style:bold; color:blue"> IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS 2024) - 6‚Äì10 May 2024 // Seoul, South Korea </span>

[[NOMS 2024 Symposium](https://noms2024.ieee-noms.org/)](<https://noms2024.ieee-noms.org/>)

I am excited to announce my attendance at the 2024 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS 2024), which took place from May 6 to May 10, 2024, at The-K Hotel in Seoul, South Korea. Returning to Korea after two decades, this symposium was a pivotal event for professionals in the network operations and management field. NOMS 2024 featured an extensive program with keynotes, technical sessions, panel discussions, and various workshops. The theme for this year was ‚ÄúTowards intelligent, reliable, and sustainable network and service management,‚Äù focusing on the latest advancements in 5G and emerging 6G networks and their roles in supporting critical applications such as IoT, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles. This event gathered researchers, developers, service providers, and policymakers, offering a unique platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration in shaping the future of network management.

At NOMS 2024, we presented our paper titled <span style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic; color:red"> "Optimal Resource Utilization in Hyperledger Fabric: A Comprehensive SPN-Based Performance Evaluation Paradigm," </span> authored by Carlos Melo, Glauber Gon√ßalves, Francisco A. Silva, Leonel Feitosa, Iure F√©, Andr√© Soares, Eunmi Choi, Tuan Anh Nguyen, and Dugki Min. Our research focuses on Hyperledger Fabric, a leading framework for permissioned blockchain systems, and aims to enhance blockchain performance and efficiency. Key points of our presentation include:

- **Development of a Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) Model:** We created an SPN model to evaluate Hyperledger Fabric's performance under various configurations.
- **Detailed Transaction Phase Analysis:** Our model offers in-depth analyses of the endorsement, ordering, and commit phases of transactions.
- **Actionable Insights for Optimization:** The model provides administrators with practical insights for optimizing blockchain configurations.
- **Support from Case Studies and Sensitivity Analysis:** We included practical case studies and a sensitivity analysis identifying critical factors affecting mean response time (MRT).
- **Impact of Configuration Parameters:** Our findings highlight the significant impact of block size and transaction arrival rates on system response times.
- **Real-World Application Validation:** The model's utility was validated through real-world applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing resource utilization and transaction throughput.

This research provides a robust framework for pre-deployment performance evaluation and capacity planning in Hyperledger Fabric, paving the way for more efficient and scalable blockchain implementations in enterprise environments.

Special thanks to our Brazillian team, coordinated by [Francisco Airton Silva](https://iuresf.gitlab.io/pasid-site/airton.html), Laboratory of Applied Research to Distributed Systems (PASID), Federal University of Piau√≠ (UFPI) (campus Picos), Teresina, Piau√≠, Brazil, for their collaboration in the research.

During the conference, I had the pleasure of meeting [Jin-Hee Cho](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~jicho/), a collaborator of my Ph.D. supervisor, [Dongseong Kim](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/23703). Jin-Hee Cho is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. It was great to converse with her and attend her fascinating research presentation. It's remarkable how small and interconnected the world can be.
