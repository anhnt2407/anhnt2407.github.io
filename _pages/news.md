Excited to share our achievements after a year of leading the AAM-VDT project at Konkuk Aerospace Design-Airworthiness Institute (KADA). We've made significant progress in developing an integrated simulation platform for the Konkuk Passenger Vehicle (KP-2) digital twin in the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) sector. Our focus on cutting-edge technologies has paved the way for a revolutionary system in urban air mobility.

The Advanced Air Mobility-Vehicle Digital Twin (AAM-VDT) project integrates cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and simulation to manage heterogeneous vehicles in real-time. Our collaboration within the KADA Research Groups - Design and Analysis, Simulation and Control, and AI Applications - has been instrumental in achieving our goals.

Our key features include cloud server integration, AI-driven operations, digital twin technology, and a strong emphasis on operational safety and management. By utilizing digital twin dynamics, ensuring safety and reliability, and implementing multi-vehicle coordination, we are shaping the future of AAM operations.
