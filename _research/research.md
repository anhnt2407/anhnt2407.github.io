## [Digital Twin Area](./DigitalTwin.md)

- Digital twin (DT) is a pioneering technology and a promising game-changer in various emerging industries.
- The concept of DT opens a world of possibilities for fundamentally the infusion of physical-twin specific computational models which are dynamically updated into a feedback loop of data-driven analysis and decision-making.
- A digital twin is a set of coupled computational models that gradually transit throughout different states in its featured state-space as time goes on, in which constantly and equivalently represent the real-world structure, behaviors and surrounding context of its physical twin.
- We are working on the development of (i) neural digital twin dynamic engines (DTDE), (ii) neural digital twin control engines (DTCE), (iii) digital twin control frame (DTCF) and (iv) digital twin cloud infrastructure (DTCI) for U*V systems.

## [Depedability and Security Quantification Area](./DependabilitySecurity.md)

- Dependability and security are of five distinctive natures (along with functionality, performance, and cost) for computing and communication systems.
- Computing systems and networks with a sophisticated composition of multi-level systems and things are inevitably prone to a chain of threats (faults, errors, and failures) which eventually causes fatal losses, such as service interruption/outage, data leak, or even human lives.
- Even a 1% failure rate is too high, because it causes 3.65 days of unscheduled downtime in a year which, in turn, may reduce an enormous amount of enterprise turnover.
- Therefore, dependability and security requirements should be taken into consideration to obtain the highest level of trustworthiness for computing infrastructures, in practice.
- We are working on the quantification methodologies for dependability and security metrics of computing systems and networks: virtualized server systems (VSS), data center networks (DCN), software defined network (SDN), Cloud-Fog-Edge Continuum (CFE), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Industrial Things (IoIT), unmanned aerial systems (UAS) etc.
